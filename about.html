    <!-- Blog Post -->
    <div class="post-preview">
        <p>Hello! I’m <a target="_blank" href="https://pfluger.ws">Jaret Pfluger</a>, the reporting hacker behind Einpost.</p>
        <p>Some call me an author, a poet, even a bard. Some say I’m a saint; others, the devil himself. The truth is, I’m just a regular schlub trying to make sense of this world, one stumble at a time. Still, it would be nice to leave it better than I found it. For that, I’ll need wisdom.</p>
        <p>What's wisdom? That’s knowing when to jump in, when to step back, and when to just walk away.</p>
        <p>Einpost is where I share the scraps of wisdom I’ve gathered along the way. It’s for anyone wandering by—including myself—a reminder of where I’ve been and maybe a marker for where I’m headed. I spend 99% of my time listening and building, mostly in tech, business, and charity. They also call me a consultant, but really, I’m just a tinkerer—stitching together systems to make sense of the chaos. And let me tell you, chaos is everywhere.</p>
        <p>Take people, for example. No matter how advanced our engineering, people are still the drivers—and too often, we’re like hamsters: spinning on the wheel, grumbling, growing cynical, running ourselves ragged, and wondering if we’ll ever get somewhere. How do I know? Because I’ve been the hamster.</p>
        <p>So we ask the big questions: What’s the point? Why the highs of joy only to crash into the lows of pain? Is there a God, or am I just a cosmic accident? What keeps me from becoming the next tyrant or drug kingpin? What rules should I live by? Ignore these questions, and life starts to feel like that hamster wheel. Once, I saw it as a trap—spinning endlessly, dictated by circumstances. But now, my perspective changed. The wheel is still mine to control, unbalanced and spinning on ignorance, waiting for wisdom to set it right.</p>
        <p>How did the wheel slow down for me? It might sound cliché, but I had a literal Jesus-come-to-me moment. That encounter stopped me from running and got me walking instead. I found my footing by going spiritual—anchoring myself to the Big Boss in the Bible. Faith, I’ve discovered, is like a frequency—something you sense but can’t quite measure. <em>Skronks</em>, I even wrote a book about this, giving it a sci-fi twist. <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" data-bs-target="#sidebar" aria-controls="sidebar"><em>Check it out!</em></a> Whatever you believe, I’ll say this: the teachings of Jesus are pure gold.</p>
        <p>And now, here I am at a crossroads. Decisions aren’t always cut-and-dry. On one hand, the good Lord has created a world of breathtaking beauty, abundant resources, and enough riches for everyone to thrive. But let’s face it, we humans aren’t always self-motivated to do what’s right. The systems we build can uplift—or destroy.</p>
        <p>Take artificial intelligence: it’s just probabilities—zeros and ones trying to mirror the chaos of our humanity. Without wisdom and safeguards, it risks leading us into a dystopian spiral. And then there’s our obsession with grand theories—Darwinism, evolution—as if they justify our ruthlessness, while the contradictions stare us in the face. Add in the insecurity cloaked in religion and our gadget-addicted culture, and it’s no wonder trust crumbles in a world so full of promise yet so short on virtue.</p>
        <p>So, yeah, I’m on the hunt for wisdom—high, low, and everywhere in between.</p>
        <p>Because with wisdom, we get a choice. Some choices are bigger than others, especially the spiritual ones. Choosing Jesus? That’s the kind of choice that echoes beyond this life—it touches the part of us that sticks around after the credits roll. And that’s just the start. Sure, the Ten Commandments bring order, and you can choose to put loving God first, people second, and let everything else fall into place. But forget God’s nature, forget the Good News, and suddenly religion replaces relationship. And trust me, that’s the last dead thing you want stinking up your closet.</p>
        <p>Here’s the deal: without wisdom, tumbles are harder to recover from. Without wisdom, five hundred meaningful words become ten thousand empty ones. Without wisdom, prickly pride turns into thorns that choke out joy.</p>
        <p>Even my sharpest critics—the ones eager to offer constructive criticism rather than the destructive kind—would agree it’s worth cultivating love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The selfish critics, on the other hand? <a href="#poemPiglove" data-bs-toggle="collapse">They’re in danger of exploding.</a></p>
        <p>What I’m after is Jesus-centered wisdom. It won’t fix the world, but it’ll fix what’s broken inside me. And when I’m patched up, I can <em>listen, laugh, and live</em> abundantly.</p>
        <p>If wisdom patches me up, it can patch you up too. Some of you already know—because you’ve been patched up yourselves.</p>
        <p>And once you’re patched up, that’s when the real living starts. <a href="#poemFruityWisdom" data-bs-toggle="collapse">Produce some fruit</a>, they say—the Godly kind.</p>

            <h3>Piglove</h3>
            <p>
                A man and his dog with a bucket of love,<br>
                Strolled down to the pigpen, blue skies up above.<br>
                With a wink and a chuckle, he scooped out a heap,<br>
                And the pigs snorted loudly, awoken from sleep.</p>

            <p>
                They gobbled it up, all that love, every bit—<br>
                Each "oink" grew much louder, each snout a snug fit.<br>
                The man kept on scooping, the dog’s ears perked upright,<br>
                Till one pig grew swollen, then squeaked in pure fright.</p>

            <p>
                The other pigs halted, their eyes open wide,<br>
                As love-filled Porky went "boom!" (splat!) on all sides.<br>
                The man looked down at his dog with a grin,<br>
                "Guess some folks can’t stomach the love we bring in."<br>

            <h3>Fruity Wisdom</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Einpost, where hamsters convene,<br>
                To hear from wise fruits with a glossy sheen.<br>
                With “Listen, Laugh, and Live” as our call,<br>
                The fruit gives advice—and hamsters consider all.</p>

            <p>The hamsters file in, with coffee in hand,<br>
                Feeling lost, out of place, a bit underplanned.<br>
                There’s Sarah the skeptic, who doubts every post,<br>
                And Bob who’s convinced that the fruit is a boast.</p>

            <!-- Pineapple's Stanza -->
            <p><strong>Pineapple</strong> speaks up, humble yet grand,<br>
                With a crown on its head, raised not by its hand.<br>
                “Stand firm, be meek, let God make you strong,<br>
                Stay sweet in spirit; with Him, you belong.”<sup><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#pineappleVerse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="pineappleVerse">1</a></sup></p>

            <div id="pineappleVerse" class="collapse">
                <p><strong>Verse:</strong> James 4:10 - "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up."<br>
                    <strong>Meaning:</strong> Pineapple’s wisdom reflects the strength and honor that come from humility and God’s grace.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Orange's Stanza -->
            <p>Then <strong>Orange</strong> rolls up with a serious face,<br>
                “Righteousness, justice—best align with grace!<br>
                Keep your zest, stay fresh, don’t get lost in the grind,<br>
                Quit squeezing out meaning that’s hard to unwind.”<sup><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#orangeVerse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="orangeVerse">2</a></sup></p>

            <div id="orangeVerse" class="collapse">
                <p><strong>Verse:</strong> Psalm 89:14 - "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you."<br>
                    <strong>Meaning:</strong> Living with righteousness and justice as a foundation reflects the values God upholds.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Grape's Stanza -->
            <p>“Life’s a cluster,” says <strong>Grape</strong>, “just look at me—<br>
                A perfect design, organic esprit!<br>
                Stick together, be ripe, don’t split from the vine,<br>
                Life’s sweeter with friends who ferment like fine wine.”<sup><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#grapeVerse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="grapeVerse">3</a></sup></p>

            <div id="grapeVerse" class="collapse">
                <p><strong>Verse:</strong> Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 - "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up."<br>
                    <strong>Meaning:</strong> Togetherness strengthens us, as Grape suggests through the image of the cluster.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Banana's Stanza -->
            <p>Then <strong>Banana</strong> pipes up, “Humans, be peeled,<br>
                You complicate life that’s already revealed!<br>
                Just slip out of trouble, don’t make such a fuss—<br>
                Take it from me, the potassium plus!”<sup><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#bananaVerse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="bananaVerse">4</a></sup></p>

            <div id="bananaVerse" class="collapse">
                <p><strong>Verse:</strong> Proverbs 17:22 - "A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones."<br>
                    <strong>Meaning:</strong> Banana’s light-hearted advice encourages a joyful, uncomplicated spirit.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Peach's Stanza -->
            <p><strong>Peach</strong> drops a line both humble and swift:<br>
                “Don’t be afraid of a bruise or a pit—<br>
                Take the bite anyway, that’s the gist of it!”<sup><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#peachVerse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="peachVerse">5</a></sup></p>

            <div id="peachVerse" class="collapse">
                <p><strong>Verse:</strong> James 1:2-3 - "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance."<br>
                    <strong>Meaning:</strong> Like life’s trials, Peach’s “bruises” and “pits” hold value and wisdom if embraced.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The hamsters all listen, they chuckle and grin,<br>
                As the fruit waxes wise from without and within.<br>
                For deep down, they know these fruits may be right—<br>
                With their pulp full of wisdom and seeds of insight.</p>

            <p>And so they all leave with some fruity reflection,<br>
                Laughing at themselves, finding odd connection.<br>
                Because at Einpost, the world’s fruitiest shrine,<br>
                It’s the hamsters who listen and the fruit who opine.</p>
