        <p>The leaves have fallen, and November has settled in like an old friend who doesn’t overstay their welcome. Here I am, smack in the heart of the Midwest—Iowa, to be exact—gearing up for next week’s trip to Washington, D.C. Where will I spend Thanksgiving? Good question. Somewhere on the road, heading East, most likely at a gas station with a cup of bad coffee and a vague sense of adventure.</p>
        <p>Will I miss my mother’s festive soiree down South? Absolutely. But don’t worry, Mom—I’ll be home for Christmas, ready to raid your kitchen and bask in the holiday cheer. And yes, I’m still puzzling over what gift to get you.</p>
        <p>November always stirs something in me. Maybe it’s the crisp air, maybe it’s the memories of Thanksgivings past. My childhood was blessed, and this time of year feels like pulling an old, familiar sweater over your head—warm, a little scratchy, and soaked with nostalgia. Of course, not everyone feels that way. Some folks would rather skip right to January and get it over with. And hey, I get it—turkey and sentimentality aren’t for everyone.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, I submitted a fresh batch of poems to the U.S. Copyright Office. It’s a little like throwing bottles into the ocean—hoping some curious soul finds one and cracks it open. If you’re that kind of wanderer, a couple of those poems are tucked away on the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page here on the blog. Think of them as Easter eggs, hidden for the folks who like to dig a little deeper.</p>
        <p>Thanksgiving. The word alone conjures up visions of overflowing tables, crowded kitchens, and that unholy moment when you realize you’ve eaten too much. We feast like kings, only to waddle away feeling more like overstuffed hogs. Balance, though—that’s the trick. Too much, too little, and life starts to feel like a bad buffet. But love? Now there’s one indulgence we can’t get enough of.</p>
        <p>That’s what I was chewing on when I wrote the poem <em>Piglove</em>. Life isn’t easy—it’s messy, unpredictable, and sometimes downright cruel. But the way we face that grind says everything. Are we the ones who show up with the pie, or the ones who take the last slice without so much as a thank you? Do we leave the world a little better, or do we wring it dry?</p>
        <p>This poem is for the givers—the folks who keep pouring themselves out for others, even when nobody seems to notice. Well, I notice. I see you. And I want you to know: your giving matters. Keep feeding, keep blessing, keep loving. Will the takers ever come around? Maybe, maybe not. But here’s the thing—what you’re doing, it’s worth it. You’re lighting up a world that’s far too often dark, and if that’s not something to be thankful for, I don’t know what is.</p>

            <h3>Piglove</h3>
            <p>
                A man and his dog with a bucket of love,<br>
                Strolled down to the pigpen, blue skies up above.<br>
                With a wink and a chuckle, he scooped out a heap,<br>
                And the pigs snorted loudly, awoken from sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                They gobbled it up, all that love, every bit—<br>
                Each "oink" grew much louder, each snout a snug fit.<br>
                The man kept on scooping, the dog’s ears perked upright,<br>
                Till one pig grew swollen, then squeaked in pure fright.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other pigs halted, their eyes open wide,<br>
                As love-filled Porky went "boom!" (splat!) on all sides.<br>
                The man looked down at his dog with a grin,<br>
                "Guess some folks can’t stomach the love we bring in."<br>
